A lightweight, high-performance video viewer for the Ultimate 64 (U64) and C64 Ultimate. This tool utilizes the hardware's built-in VIC-stream to display your C64 screen directly on your PC with minimal latency—no capture card required. Built with .NET 8 and Avalonia UI.

## 📺 Overview
The **C64U Slim-Viewer** allows you to stream the VIC-II video output of your Ultimate 64 directly to your modern linux or windows desktop via your local network.

### Key Features
* 🚀 **Low Latency:** The tool operates as a passive UDP listener. It no longer sends active control commands to the hardware, minimizing network overhead and avoiding conflicts with other tools. You control the stream directly from your C64. As soon as the hardware starts sending data, the viewer displays the frame.
* 🪶 **Minimalist Design:** A distraction-free window perfect for coding or gaming.
* 🔄 **Auto-Update Check:** In-app notifications for new GitHub releases.
* 🐧 **Cross-Platform:** Native support for Linux (.deb) and Windows.

### 🕹️ Supported Hardware
* **Ultimate 64** / **Ultimate 64 Elite** (Full support)
* **Ultimate-II+** (Standard version with Ethernet)
* ⚠️ **Note:** The **Ultimate-II+L** (L-version) is **NOT supported**, as it lacks the video streaming capabilities in its hardware/firmware.

## 🔌 Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to establish a connection between your C64U and this viewer.

### 1. Network Requirements
* Ensure your **Commodore 64 Ultimate (C64U)** is on the same local network as this PC.
* **Important:** Your C64U must be connected via **LAN**. Disable WLAN on the C64U to ensure a stable stream.

### 2. Firewall Settings
* Ensure that **Port 11000 for UDP** is open in your PC's firewall. This port is required to receive the incoming data stream.
* **Windows:** You usually don't need to do anything. Windows Firewall will automatically ask for permission on the first startup. Ensure you allow access.

* **Linux:** Most distributions (like Ubuntu, Mint, Debian) don't block this by default. However, if you have a strict firewall enabled (like `ufw`), you must manually allow UDP traffic:
    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow 11000/udp
    ```
### 3. Configure the C64U Hardware
Now, you need to tell your Ultimate 64 where to send the video data:

**Step A: Configure Data Streams**
* In the C64U main menu, press **F2** (SHIFT+F1).
* Navigate to `Data Streams` -> `Stream VIC to:`.
* Replace the existing IP address with your **Client-IP** (your PC's IP) and port **11000**.

**Step B: Start the Stream**
* In the C64U main menu, press **F1**.
* Navigate to `Streams` -> `VIC Streams` -> `Send to [Client-IP]:11000`.
* Press **Enter**.
