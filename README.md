## 🔌 Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to establish a connection between your C64U and this viewer.

### 1. Network Requirements
* Ensure your **Commodore 64 Ultimate (C64U)** is on the same local network as this PC.
* **Important:** Your C64U must be connected via **LAN**. Disable WLAN on the C64U to ensure a stable stream.

### 2. IP Configuration
* Find the IP address of your C64U in the hardware settings.
* Enter this IP into the top-left corner of the C64U Slim-Viewer.
* *Recommendation:* Configure your router to assign a static IP address to your C64U.

### 3. Firewall Settings
* Ensure that **Port 11000 for UDP** is open in your PC's firewall. This port is required to receive the incoming data stream.
* **Windows:** You usually don't need to do anything. Windows Firewall will automatically ask for permission on the first startup. Ensure you allow access.
* **Linux:** Most distributions (like Ubuntu, Mint, Debian) don't block this by default. However, if you have a strict firewall enabled (like `ufw`), you must manually allow UDP traffic:
    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow 11000/udp
    ```

### 4. Configure the C64U Hardware
Now, you need to tell your Ultimate 64 where to send the video data:

**Step A: Configure Data Streams**
* In the C64U main menu, press **F3** (or SHIFT+F2).
* Navigate to `Data Streams` -> `Stream VIC to:`.
* Replace the existing IP address with your **Client-IP** (your PC's IP) and port **11000**.

> [!NOTE]
> *Insert Screenshot of F3 Menu here*

**Step B: Start the Stream**
* In the C64U main menu, press **F1**.
* Navigate to `Streams` -> `VIC Streams` -> `Send to [Client-IP]:11000`.
* Press **Enter**.

> [!NOTE]
> *Insert Screenshot of F1 Menu here*

### 5. Final Step
* Click the **'Start Stream'** button within the C64U Slim-Viewer application.
